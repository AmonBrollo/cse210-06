## Overview

---
<!-- 
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them. -->

## Rules

---

<!-- Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.

```
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
```

A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
The cycles turn white.
Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other. -->
